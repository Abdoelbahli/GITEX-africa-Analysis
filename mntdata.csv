Hasta Auctions,"Stand No - 9B-21, Hall No - Hall 9",Morocco,"The used vehicle market in Morocco and most of Africa remains informal and unpredictable. 90%+ of transactions are informal, and due to the efforts of informal middlemen even the government has little visibility on this sector.

As a first step, we built a B2B auction marketplace helping companies with fleets sell to car dealers - a sort of digital ""semsar"" for companies. Sellers get rid of their used inventory quickly, easily and at a fair price (better liquidity), while buyers have access to a wider selection of pre-inspected vehicles (better sourcing). Both get full transparency for the first time. This liquidity machine allows us to build the market's first condition-specific appraisal tool.
